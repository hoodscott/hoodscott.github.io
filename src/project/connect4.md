### Description

I wanted to try and make something using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) to get to know the language a little better.  I noticed someone had just implemented a minimax package so thought I could make a simple game which could then use my own implementation of minimax to see how the code compares.  I'm not convinced my implementation is any good but I found it pretty difficult to debug - I think I should have chosen a simpler game to simulate.  An easy way to make it better would be to add more logic to the scoring function as right now it only scores winning or losing board states.
