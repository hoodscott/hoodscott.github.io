### Description

Typing game made for [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) #54 with the theme of "[Curses](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-54)".  Game was made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

I felt the game jam went pretty well.  I had a strong idea and managed to implement most of what I wanted in the timeframe.  The game ended up coming 1st for Theme and 4th overall.

### Conclusions

- Participating in a game jam gives you a deadline to hit which provides a little bit extra motivation to actually finish the game.
- It also gets a few extra people to play your game as the judges are other players.
